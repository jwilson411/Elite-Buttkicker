# Streamlined Startup Implementation

> **Historical design note - not current behaviour.** This file records how a feature was
> implemented when it was written. Ports, file locations, console output and setup steps
> described here have since changed. For how the application behaves today, see the repository
> [README](../../README.md) and the code itself; this note is kept only for design history.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Interactive Setup UI
- ❌ **Old**: Application prompted user to select audio device
- ❌ **Old**: Application prompted user to configure journal path
- ✅ **New**: Application auto-configures with sensible defaults

### 2. Auto-Configuration
- **Audio Device**: Automatically sets to system default device (-1)
- **Journal Path**: Auto-detects standard Elite Dangerous folder
- **Web UI**: Launches immediately without user interaction

### 3. New Startup Flow

**Standard Mode:**
```

🔧 Open http://localhost:5000 to configure audio device and test patterns
⏹️  Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

**Debug Mode:**
```bash
EDButtkicker --debug
```

Shows additional information:
- System audio device enumeration
- Auto-configuration details
- Journal path detection results
- Detailed logging throughout operation

### 4. User Experience Improvements

**Before:**
1. Run application
2. Wait for device enumeration
3. Choose audio device from list
4. Confirm journal path
5. Application starts
6. Open web browser manually

**After:**
1. Run application
2. Application starts immediately with defaults
3. Web interface available at http://localhost:5000
4. User can configure audio device through web UI if needed

### 5. Web UI Integration

The audio device selection is now handled entirely through the web interface:
- User can see all available devices
- Real-time device switching
- Test patterns to verify audio routing
- Persistent settings saved to configuration

### 6. Benefits for Your Friend's Testing

**Faster Testing:**
- No more interactive setup delays
- Immediate access to web interface
- Quick iteration on device configurations

**Better Debugging:**
- Debug mode still shows all device information
- Audio routing issues visible in web UI
- Real-time feedback on device changes

**Improved User Experience:**
- Works out of the box with system defaults
- Professional application behavior
- Clear next steps displayed on startup

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start (Normal Users)
```bash
# Just run the application
EDButtkicker

# Open browser to http://localhost:5000
# Configure audio device if needed
# Start Elite Dangerous and play!
```

### Debug Mode (Troubleshooting)
```bash
# Enable debug logging
EDButtkicker --debug

# Shows detailed audio device information
# Logs all configuration steps
# Provides troubleshooting information
```

### Help Information
```bash
# Show usage information
EDButtkicker --help
```

This streamlined approach will make testing much faster and provide a better user experience for distribution, while still maintaining the debug capabilities needed for troubleshooting audio routing issues.
